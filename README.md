ABSTRACT: 
Water is a basic need in every one’s life. Saving water and proper usage of water is very 
important. In this project we are proposing an alarm when there is rain, so that we can make 
some actions for rain water harvesting and also save the rain water for using it later.  
We use rain sensor for detection of the rain. It act as a simple switch, where the switch is 
normally open and when there is rain, the switch closes . The rain water sensor is connected to 
the circuit and voltage should be passed through the wires. 
 If there is no rain, the resistance between the contacts will be very high as there will be no 
conduction between the wires in the sensor. If there is rain, the water drops will fall on the rain 
sensor, which will form a conductive path between the wires and it also decreases the resistance 
between the contacts. This action activates the IC and buzzer sounds. 
 Some of the applications of this rain alert alarm are:  
Irrigation field  
Home Automation  
Communication Automobiles  
Casual household chores 
APPROACH TOWARDS APPLICATION: 
We started with a rain alert alarm and found it very useful in many real life applications and 
innovated the project completely towards a application: IRRIGATION FIELD. 
So we’ll be providing a drip irrigation switch which will get deactivated when rain is detected.. 
 
BRIEF DESCRIPTION: 
Our project is to design a rain alert alarm which is provided in the point of view of approach 
towards an application: IRRIGATION FIELD. Leveraging the capabilities of a rain sensor, 
NPN transistors, resistors, LEDs, a buzzer, and a drip irrigation switch, the system aims to 
detect rain and initiate actions such as visual and audible alerts, as well as control over irrigation 
systems. This project serves as a practical, cost-effective solution for individuals seeking to 
automate their irrigation processes and enhance environmental responsiveness. 
Introduction 
In agriculture and gardening, the timely detection of rain is crucial for optimizing irrigation 
practices. Traditional irrigation systems may continue to water plants even during rainfall, 
resulting in unnecessary water usage and potential damage to plants. The Rain Alert Alarm 
System addresses this challenge by incorporating a rain sensor and electronic components to 
detect rain and trigger corresponding actions. 
Objectives 
1. Rain Detection: 
• Develop a reliable rain detection mechanism using a rain sensor. 
• Utilize the rain sensor output to serve as the primary trigger for the system. 
2. Alert System: 
• Implement a visual indicator using an LED to display the rain detection status. 
• Incorporate an audible alert through a buzzer to notify users when rain is 
detected. 
3. Irrigation Control: 
• Integrate a drip irrigation switch to control the irrigation system. 
• Ensure the irrigation switch turns off during rain to prevent unnecessary 
watering. 
4. Simple and Accessible Design: 
• Design the system without using a microcontroller, making it accessible to a 
broader audience with basic electronics skills.
